# Interpreted-Context-Methdology

ICM is a framework for building structured, multi-stage AI workflows out of markdown files and folder conventions. Each workspace gives AI agents the right context at each stage of a task, and gives humans clear edit surfaces between stages.

## Folder Map

## Routing

| You want to... | Go to |
|-----------------|-------|
| Create content with script-to-animation | `workspaces/script-to-animation/CLAUDE.md` |
| Build course slide decks from source material | `workspaces/course-deck-production/CLAUDE.md` |
| Generate release notes from any git repo | `workspaces/release-notes/CLAUDE.md` |
| Write a tutorial about any project feature | `workspaces/tutorials/CLAUDE.md` |
| Build a marketing video for any product (Hormozi method) | `workspaces/marketing-video/CLAUDE.md` |
| Build a new workspace for any domain | `workspaces/workspace-builder/CLAUDE.md` |
| Read the full MWP specification | `_core/CONVENTIONS.md` |
| Understand the placeholder system | `_core/placeholder-syntax.md` |
| Use a template for a new workspace | `_core/templates/` |

## Triggers

| Keyword | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `setup` | Run onboarding in whatever workspace you are in |
| `status` | Show pipeline completion for the current workspace |

## How It Works

Each workspace is self-contained with its own CLAUDE.md. Navigate into a workspace folder and that workspace's CLAUDE.md takes over. You do not need to read this root file once you are inside a workspace.
